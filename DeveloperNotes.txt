Special Cases: 
    Call of Khrulhu is the only lifesteal that has a decreased lifesteal multiplier when buffed. (40%)

Damage Calculation:
    Pip-based damage spells are in a separate "PerPip" value which needs to be calculated upon cast.
    DOT spells are two-fold with the "DOT" showing per round damage and the "Rounds" showing the length of time.
    If a DOT spell has an intial hit, the damage is stored in the "Damage" value. All other damage is in "DOT".
    Lifesteal will be calculated upon final damage calculation with the provided "Lifesteal" multiplier.
